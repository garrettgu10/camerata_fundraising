            Dear Friends and Families,<br>
             <br>
            The Camerata School opened this fall in the Frisco Square. It is a Christian and classical school for K-12 students. We also provide a Conservatory for the Fine Arts in order to train students who have a desire for excellence in piano, voice, instruments, drama, and visual arts.<br>
             <br>
            The Camerata School is a Christian school built on the foundation of God's Word and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. When students know Jesus as Lord and Savior, our teaching truly changes hearts and transforms lives.<br>
             <br>
            As a classical school, we seek to help our students appreciate the importance of preserving the past. We want our students to understand the wealth of wisdom and knowledge of those who have gone before us to create great music, literature, and art.<br>
            <br>
            As a 21st century school, we desire for our students to be well prepared for the complexities of today's world. Thus, we provide classes as part of the STEAM initiative to educate and train our students in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math.<br>
             <br>
            In September, we had a Shakespeare on the Square dinner and concert at the Camerata School. We were tremendously blessed to have Cynthia Gu share her talents as a gifted pianist.  <br>
             <br>
            We are honored to have young and talented musicians in the Dallas area to perform concerts to raise funds for the Camerata School. With these funds, we can purchase pianos and instruments as well as lab equipment for our science and technology programs.<br>
             <br>
            The Camerata School is a non-profit 501c3; your gift is tax deductible. We thank you for your heart for excellence in education and the arts.<br>
             <br>
            There will be a series of concerts performed by these excellent musicians who are graciously donating their time in order to enhance the education at the Camerata School. <br>
            <br>
            What a glorious opportunity for us to enjoy special evenings of beautiful music performed by gifted musicians! We are deeply grateful for these young people generously sharing their talents and music in order for us to enjoy this lovely classical music. As an added blessing, the concerts will provide the funds needed for the Camerata School to provide quality Christian and classical education, as well as a conservatory to enhance musical training for students.<br>
             <br>
            <blockquote>The aim and final end of all music should be none other than the glory of God and the refreshment of the soul.<br><div style="text-align:right">--Johann Sebastian Bach</div></blockquote>
             <br>
            With a grateful heart,<br>
             <br>
